//! Making the application's Tokio runtime findable while Venus polls a task.
//!
//! Venus owns the UI thread and Tokio owns the sockets: the driver threads run
//! beside the frame, so a TLS handshake or a response decode never eats frame
//! time, and the completion comes home through Venus's waker into the phase the
//! task was spawned into.
//!
//! One thing does not follow from that split. A future from a runtime-backed
//! ecosystem builds its resources on its *first poll* and looks the runtime up
//! in a thread-local — `reqwest`'s connector registering a socket with the
//! reactor, `tokio::time::sleep` registering with the timer wheel. Venus polls
//! on the UI thread, where that thread-local is empty, so such a future would
//! panic with "there is no reactor running" before it ever reached the network.
//!
//! Entering the handle for the duration of a poll is the whole fix, and it is
//! what this adapter is.
