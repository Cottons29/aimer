//! The region of the window the platform keeps for itself.
//!
//! [`aimer_widget::safe_area`] holds the answer and rebuilds the widgets that
//! follow it; this module is where the answer comes from. Only two platforms
//! reserve anything, and neither of them tells winit about it:
//!
//! | Platform | Read from | Change reported as |
//! |----------|-----------|--------------------|
//! | iOS      | `UIView.safeAreaInsets` | a resize or a scale-factor change — a rotation moves the notch and the home indicator (see `ffi_utils::ios_safe_area`) |
//! | web      | the `env(safe-area-inset-*)` CSS variables | `resize` / `orientationchange` on the browser window (see `ffi_utils::web_safe_area`) |
//! | others   | nothing — the whole window is usable | never |
//!
//! Everywhere else this compiles to nothing at all: [`announce`] has an empty
//! body, so a desktop build carries no query, no branch and no allocation for a
//! reservation that is always zero.
//!
//! The translation from each platform's raw numbers is kept here, apart from
//! the FFI that fetches them, because it is the part that can be stated exactly
//! — and so the part worth testing on any host.
