//! iOS' safe area, read off UIKit's view.
//!
//! The status bar, the notch and the home indicator sit *over* the
//! application's surface: content painted under them is visible but not
//! touchable, because a touch landing there belongs to the system. UIKit states
//! how much of each edge that costs as `UIView.safeAreaInsets`, and winit
//! exposes none of it — neither a query nor an event — so the view is asked
//! directly.
//!
//! There is nothing to observe: the insets only change when the view's geometry
//! does, and a rotation, a resize and a scale-factor change all reach the
//! application as window events already. So this is read from those, never
//! polled and never read per frame — one `objc_msgSend` on the events that can
//! possibly have moved the notch, and nothing at all in between.
//!
//! UIKit measures in points, which are the logical pixels
//! [`aimer_widget::SafeAreaInsets`] is defined in, so nothing is scaled on the
//! way through.

// `objc`'s `msg_send!` / `sel!` expand to a `cfg(cargo-clippy)` check that this
// crate does not declare.
