//! The light or dark appearance the operating system currently asks for.
//!
//! [`aimer_widget::platform_brightness`] holds the answer and rebuilds the
//! widgets that follow it; this module is where the answer comes from. Every
//! platform has its own idea of where that lives, and only some of them tell
//! winit about it:
//!
//! | Platform            | Read from                                         | Change reported as                       |
//! |---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
//! | macOS, Windows, X11, web | [`Window::theme`]                            | [`winit::event::WindowEvent::ThemeChanged`] |
//! | iOS                 | `UITraitCollection.userInterfaceStyle`             | a UIKit trait change (see `ffi_utils::ios_appearance`) |
//! | Android             | `ACONFIGURATION_UI_MODE_NIGHT_*`                   | a configuration change, which winit forwards as [`winit::event::WindowEvent::ScaleFactorChanged`] |
//!
//! winit answers `None` from [`Window::theme`] on both mobile platforms and
//! never emits `ThemeChanged` there, so each of them is asked directly. The
//! translation from the platform's raw value is kept here, apart from the FFI
//! that fetches it, because it is the part that can be stated exactly — and so
//! the part worth testing on any host.
