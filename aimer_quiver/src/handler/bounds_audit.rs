//! Differential audit of cached interaction bounds against the render tree.
//!
//! Many elements publish their hit-test rectangle while they are updated, by
//! reading the legacy canvas transform stack (`pos_start_end`). The render tree
//! already holds every node's world rectangle, derived from layout. Replacing
//! the first source with the second is only safe where they agree, so this audit
//! lists, for a synchronized tree, every element whose cached rectangle differs
//! from its node's world rectangle by more than a pixel. Both are in logical
//! pixels: `CacheBounds` divides by the scale when it saves.
