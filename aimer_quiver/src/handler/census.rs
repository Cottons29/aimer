//! Diagnostic census of how a window's render nodes obtain their paint.
//!
//! A node either records its own commands (`LocalV2`) or is captured as a
//! legacy island, which owns its whole subtree: every descendant of an island
//! is drawn by the legacy path no matter what it could do itself. The census
//! therefore reports islands and the nodes they swallow separately, so a
//! single non-migrated wrapper high in the tree cannot hide behind a healthy
//! looking `LocalV2` count.
//!
//! The frame loop reports it under the `frame-stats` feature; otherwise only
//! tests call it.
