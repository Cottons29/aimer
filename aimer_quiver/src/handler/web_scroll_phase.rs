/// Winit's web backend emits every `WindowEvent::MouseWheel` with a hardcoded

/// reports when the fingers touch or leave a trackpad. Widgets, however, are
/// written against a well-formed `Started → Moved* → Ended` sequence, so the
/// missing boundaries are inferred here and injected into the smoother:
///
/// * the first event after an idle pause opens a gesture, and
/// * a gesture closes once the stream goes quiet for [`IDLE_GAP_MS`], or as
///   soon as the cursor moves, because moving the pointer means the user
///   aimed at something else and the next wheel event is a new intent.
///
/// The tracker only decides *when* a gesture begins and ends; it never
