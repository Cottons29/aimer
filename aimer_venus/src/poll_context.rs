//! The hook a host runtime installs so futures from other ecosystems can be
//! polled on the UI thread.

/// Something a host runtime has to be *inside of* while a task is polled.
///
/// Venus polls futures on the thread that owns the frame and has no runtime
/// context of its own. That is enough for a future that only awaits other
/// futures, and it is not enough for the ecosystems built on a runtime:
/// `reqwest`, `tokio::fs`, `tokio::time::sleep` and their relatives construct
/// their resources lazily on the *first poll* and look their runtime up in a
/// thread-local. Polled bare, they panic with "there is no reactor running" —
/// which is a fact about where the poll happened, not about the future.
///
/// A host that wants those futures to work installs an adapter with
/// [`Venus::set_poll_context`](crate::Venus::set_poll_context). Venus keeps no
/// knowledge of any runtime: it only knows how to run a closure inside whatever
/// the host handed it.
///
/// The completion side needs nothing here — a foreign reactor wakes Venus's
/// waker from its own thread, and the task resumes in the frame phase it was
/// spawned into, exactly as an [`offload`](crate::Venus::offload) result does.
///
/// # Implementing
///
/// The context must be entered for the duration of the call and no longer.
/// Holding a runtime guard across an `await` would leave the whole thread
/// marked as being inside that runtime *between* polls, which is the state such
/// guards exist to scope.
