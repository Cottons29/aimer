/// Venus is a scheduler, not a replacement for Tokio. It owns the *ordering* of
/// asynchronous work relative to a frame, and one small pool for work that must
/// leave the thread; real I/O runtimes remain welcome alongside it.
///
/// What it gives a GUI that a general-purpose runtime cannot:
///
/// - **Non-`Send` tasks.** A handler may `await` while holding a `StateUpdater`,
///   a controller, or any other `Rc` from the element tree.
/// - **Frame phases.** A resolved future's `set_state` lands before *this*
///   frame's build instead of a frame later.
/// - **A budget.** Background work runs only in the slack of a frame, and stops
///   when the slack runs out.
/// - **Structural cancellation.** An unmounting element drops a [`TaskScope`]
///   and its tasks are gone.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Driving one frame, the way an event loop does:
///
/// ```
/// use std::cell::Cell;
/// use std::rc::Rc;
///
/// use aimer_venus::Venus;
///
/// let venus = Venus::new();
/// let state = Rc::new(Cell::new(0));
/// let built_with = Rc::new(Cell::new(0));
///
/// let mutated = state.clone();
/// venus.spawn(async move { mutated.set(9) });
///
/// let read = state.clone();
/// let observed = built_with.clone();
/// venus.drive_frame(|| observed.set(read.get()));
///
/// assert_eq!(built_with.get(), 9, "the effect landed before the build");
