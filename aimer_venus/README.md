# aimer_venus

Aimer's UI-thread async runtime.

Venus is **not** a replacement for Tokio. It owns the one thing a
general-purpose runtime cannot express — *when*, relative to a frame,
asynchronous work runs — and it owns one small pool for work that has to leave
the UI thread. Bring your own I/O runtime for sockets; Venus schedules the UI.

## Why it exists

A server runtime optimises throughput across thousands of sockets. A UI runtime
optimises something else entirely:

| Concern         | Server runtime      | Venus                              |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| Unit of time    | none, run ASAP      | the frame (16.6 / 8.3 ms)          |
| Thread model    | work-stealing pool  | one UI thread + optional offload   |
| `Send` bound    | required            | only at the `offload` boundary     |
| Wake → run      | µs, unordered      | before *this* frame's build phase  |
| Backpressure    | queue depth         | frame budget, deadline-aware       |
| Cancellation    | rare                | constant, tied to the element tree |

Three of those are load-bearing for a GUI:

- **Tasks are not `Send`.** A handler may `await` while holding a `StateUpdater`,
  a controller, or any other `Rc` from the element tree — which is what 95 % of
  real handlers capture. A runtime that polls on a pool cannot allow that at any
  price.
- **Tasks run in a phase.** "As soon as possible" is not a schedule a UI can be
  built on. A resolved future's `set_state` has to be visible to *this* frame's
  build, not the next one; anything else is a one-frame input lag that is
  structural, not tunable.
- **Background work is budgeted.** An 8.3 ms frame has no room for a 40 ms
  decode, and a scheduler that cannot measure the slack it is spending will
  eventually spend a frame.

## The frame

```text
input ──▶ frame tasks ──▶ microtasks ──▶ build / layout / paint ──▶ idle ──▶ present
              │                │                                      │
       animation ticks   drained to        the caller's work    budget-gated,
       once per frame    exhaustion                             resumable
```

| Phase       | Runs                       | For                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Microtask` | before the build, to empty | `set_state`, focus change, notify          |
| `Frame`     | once per frame             | animation ticks, after-layout callbacks    |
| `Idle`      | while the frame has room   | image decode, glyph raster, prefetch       |

Everything unsliceable goes to `Venus::offload`, the single place `Send` is
required — and where it is genuinely true.

## Using it

```rust
use std::cell::Cell;
use std::rc::Rc;

use aimer_venus::Venus;

let venus = Venus::for_refresh_rate(120.0);
let counter = Rc::new(Cell::new(0));

// A task holding an `Rc`, resolved before the build that reads it.
let counted = counter.clone();
venus.spawn(async move { counted.set(counted.get() + 1) });

let read = counter.clone();
venus.drive_frame(|| assert_eq!(read.get(), 1));
```

Blocking work leaves the thread and comes back into the frame:

```rust
# use std::cell::Cell;
# use std::rc::Rc;
use aimer_venus::Venus;

let venus = Venus::new();
let state = Rc::new(Cell::new(0));

let runtime = venus.clone();
let mutated = state.clone();
venus.spawn(async move {
    let bytes = runtime.offload(|| vec![0_u8; 1024]).await;
    // Still on the UI thread, still holding the `Rc`.
    mutated.set(bytes.len());
});

while venus.task_count() > 0 {
    venus.run_microtasks();
}
assert_eq!(state.get(), 1024);
```

An element that owns tasks owns a scope, and unmounting cancels them:

```rust
# use aimer_venus::Venus;
let venus = Venus::new();
let scope = venus.scope();

venus.spawn_in(scope.id(), async { /* fetch, decode, … */ });

drop(scope); // the element unmounted: the task is simply gone
assert_eq!(venus.task_count(), 0);
```

Long background work slices itself against the deadline:

```rust
# use aimer_venus::{Venus, yield_if_over_budget};
let venus = Venus::new();

venus.spawn_idle(async {
    for _tile in 0..4096 {
        // decode_one_tile();
        yield_if_over_budget().await;
    }
});

venus.run_idle(&venus.idle_budget());
```

## Driving it from an event loop

```text
venus.begin_frame();
venus.run_frame_tasks();     // animation ticks
venus.run_microtasks();      // every resolved effect, before the build
build_layout_paint();
venus.run_idle(&venus.idle_budget());
venus.end_frame();           // records whether the frame overran
```

`Venus::drive_frame` does exactly that. A loop that needs to interleave its own
work calls the phases individually, which is what Aimer's own loop does: the
frame tasks and the microtask drain sit at the end of
`AimerApplicationHandler::begin_frame`, after this frame's input and before the
tree is built, and the idle pass sits in `end_frame` once it has been drawn.
Both the windowed loop and the headless application go through those two, so a
frame costs the same work whichever asked for it.

The runtime is installed for the drawing thread when the application starts, so
a handler eleven elements deep reaches it through `Venus::current` or
`spawn_local` rather than being handed a spawner from above.

Two things a loop should know:

- `has_ready_work()` — whether it may wait for OS events or has to come round
  again immediately.
- `set_notifier(..)` — how a worker wakes a parked loop. Called *only* for wakes
  raised off the UI thread; a wake raised on the UI thread never pings it,
  because the loop is demonstrably awake.

## Costs, honestly

- A task pays one `Box::pin` at spawn and nothing per poll. Polling a ready task
  is a `VecDeque::pop_front`, a slab index and one `Future::poll` — tens of
  nanoseconds, so draining ten thousand microtasks fits comfortably inside a
  120 Hz frame.
- A cooperative scheduler cannot preempt. An `async` handler that does 12 ms of
  straight-line work with no `await` will drop a frame; debug builds print the
  offending poll's duration so the author hears about it before a user does.
- A microtask drain is deliberately unbudgeted, so a microtask that re-wakes
  itself forever hangs the frame. Debug builds assert once the drain passes
  100 000 polls.
