//! Gesture recognition: pointer events in, [`GestureEvent`]s out.
//!
//! The recognizer is a **pure function over a state machine**
//! ([`recognize::recognize`]) rather than a method on a widget. Nothing in
//! [`state`] or [`recognize`] touches an `Rc`, a window, a callback or a
//! `BuildContext`, and the current time arrives as a parameter — so the whole
//! tap / double-tap / long-press / slop / pinch matrix is unit-testable with a
//! fake clock, which is exactly what the previous design could not do.
//!
//! [`gesture_detector::GestureDetector`] is the thin widget on top: it
//! translates [`aimer_events::element::ElementEvent`] into
//! [`aimer_events::pointer::PointerEvent`], calls the recognizer, and fans the
//! output out to handlers.
