//! The feedback that follows the pointer, painted above everything.
//!
//! A dragged card has to be visible outside the column it came from, outside
//! the scrollable that clips that column, and above any modal on screen. No
//! position in the widget tree satisfies all three, so the feedback is not in
//! the tree at all: it is painted by an [`OverlayLayer`] installed on the modal
//! host for exactly as long as the drag lasts.
//!
//! The layer is a painter, not an element — it never receives an event, which
//! matters because it sits directly under the pointer it is chasing and would
//! otherwise intercept the very moves that drive it.
