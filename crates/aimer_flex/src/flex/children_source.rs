//! Child storage behind [`RawFlex`](crate::flex::raw_flex::RawFlex).
//!
//! A flex container used to own a `Vec<AnyElement>` outright, which meant the
//! whole child list had to exist before the container did. For a list of a
//! hundred thousand rows that is half a million allocations paid before the
//! first frame — and paid again on every rebuild, because
//! [`Widget::to_element`] runs on every rebuild.
//!
//! Indirecting through [`ChildrenSource`] lets the container ask for children by
//! index instead of owning them. Two implementations cover the two regimes:
//!
//! - [`EagerChildren`] holds the vector, exactly as before. Everything reached
//!   through [`Flex::children`](crate::Flex::children) uses it, so its behaviour
//!   is unchanged down to the allocation count.
//! - [`WindowedChildren`] holds the *data* plus the mapper and materializes only
//!   the index range a frame asks for. A hundred-thousand-row list then builds a
//!   couple of dozen elements instead of a hundred thousand.
//!
//! # The sparse-children contract
//!
//! A windowed source deliberately exposes fewer children than it has. That is
//! visible to every tree walk, so the meaning of each one is fixed here:
//!
//! - [`ChildrenSource::len`] is the *logical* count and is always exact. It is
//!   what the layout table and the scroll extent are derived from.
//! - [`ChildrenSource::visit`] yields the *materialized* children only. Tree
//!   walks that reach it — structural inspection, broadcasts, lifecycle
//!   delivery — therefore see the live window, not the whole list. An element
//!   outside the window does not exist yet, so there is nothing to deliver to.
//! - Identity *is* preserved while a row stays inside the window, overscan
//!   included, so a one-pixel scroll never rebuilds what is on screen. It also
//!   survives leaving the window: a bounded pool keeps the elements of the
//!   [`RECYCLED`] most recently dropped rows, so scrolling a screen away and back
//!   returns the very same element, with its state, focus, and layout cache.
//! - Beyond that pool per-child state is **not** durable. State that has to
//!   outlive it belongs above the list, in the data the mapper reads.
//! - A rebuild of the container *does* preserve it: the replacement claims every
//!   row the old source held through
//!   [`Rebuildable::adopt_runtime_state_from`](aimer_widget::Rebuildable::adopt_runtime_state_from),
//!   and the live state of a claimed row is carried into the row it builds for
//!   the same identity. Identity is the row's index, or the key
//!   [`FlexList::key`](crate::FlexList::key) derives from the datum, which is
//!   what makes state follow an item that moved.
//! - A freshly built windowed container has an *empty* window until its first
//!   frame. Reconciliation walks children by sibling position, so an empty
//!   window is what keeps a rebuild from pairing row 12 of the old window with
//!   row 12 of a differently positioned new one; the hand-off above replaces
//!   that pairing with an explicit one.
//!
//! Windowing is only sound when the container can state its total extent
//! without measuring it child by child. That holds when the extent is declared
//! through [`FlexList::item_extent`](crate::FlexList::item_extent), and when it
//! is predicted from a single probed child — see
//! [`RawFlex::estimated_layout`](crate::flex::raw_flex::RawFlex). A prediction
//! that turns out wrong is corrected child by child rather than abandoned, so a
//! list of varying rows stays windowed. Only a shape no per-child correction can
//! describe — a flex child, a wrapped line, a bounded main axis — makes a source
//! stop windowing through [`ChildrenSource::materialize_all`]; that decision is
//! final, which keeps a container from alternating between the two regimes frame
//! after frame.
