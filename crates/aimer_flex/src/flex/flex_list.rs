//! Data-driven children for the flex containers.
//!
//! [`Column::children`](crate::Column::children) takes a collection of widgets,
//! which forces the caller to materialize one widget per item — usually through
//! a `Vec<AnyWidget>` and a `.boxed()` per element:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let items: Vec<AnyWidget> = (0..120_000)
//!     .map(|i| Container::new().child(Text::new(format!("Item {i}"))).boxed())
//!     .collect();
//! Column::new().children(items)
//! ```
//!
//! [`Column::list`](crate::Column::list) keeps the *data* instead and maps it to
//! children only while the element tree is built:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! Column::new()
//!     .horizontal_alignment(BoxAlignment::Start)
//!     .list(0..120_000)
//!     .builder(|i| Container::new().child(Text::new(format!("Item {i}"))))
//! ```
//!
//! Two costs disappear. The mapper's return type is one concrete widget, so no
//! item is type-erased, and the retained widget tree holds `Vec<T>` — four bytes
//! per item for a range of `u32` — instead of a vector of boxed containers, each
//! carrying decoration, borders, and an owned string.
//!
//! The data source is a `Vec<T>` rather than an
//! [`Iterator`](core::iter::Iterator) on purpose: [`Widget::to_element`] takes
//! `&self` and runs again on every rebuild, so the source has to be replayable
//! and indexable. `IntoIterator` is accepted at the call boundary, which keeps
//! ranges, arrays, vectors, and `map` chains ergonomic.
