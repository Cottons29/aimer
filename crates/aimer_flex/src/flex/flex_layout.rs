//! Cached main-axis layout table shared by `RawFlex::computed_size` and
//! `RawFlex::draw`.
//!
//! A flex container used to resolve every child's size and position twice per
//! frame — once while measuring and once while painting — which made both
//! passes `O(children)` even when a viewport exposed a dozen of them. The table
//! built here holds that result for as long as the incoming
//! [`BoxConstraint`] and scale stay the same, so painting a scrolled list only
//! has to look up the index range it actually covers.
//!
//! Two properties make the lookup cheap:
//!
//! - Main-axis starts are accumulated in `f64`. A list of 120 000 rows of 110px
//!   reaches 13.2 million logical pixels, where the `f32` step is already ~2px
//!   and deep-scroll positions visibly drift.
//! - A list whose children all resolved to the same size stores one size and a
//!   single stride instead of a full offset table, which turns the range lookup
//!   into a division and keeps the memory flat.
//!
//! A table whose extents were *predicted* from a single probe carries a third
//! part: a [`Refinement`] holding the exact extent of every child a frame
//! actually painted. Correcting the prediction one child at a time is what lets
//! a list of non-uniform rows stay windowed — the alternative is to measure all
//! of them, which is the cost the prediction exists to avoid.
