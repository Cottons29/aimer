//! The two shapes a context menu is drawn in, and where each one lands.
//!
//! A finger has no cursor to aim with and hides the screen where it touches, so
//! a touch menu is the *pill* every mobile system draws: a short horizontal bar
//! of verbs floating clear of the thing it acts on. A mouse points at an exact
//! spot and expects the menu to appear *there*, growing down and to the right
//! like every desktop menu since 1988 — the *list*.
//!
//! The shape is the input device's choice, not the platform's, so a phone
//! browser and a desktop browser each get the shape their user is holding.
