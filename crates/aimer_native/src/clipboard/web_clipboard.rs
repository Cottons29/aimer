//! The web, through `navigator.clipboard` where it exists and a selected
//! `<textarea>` where it does not.
//!
//! `writeText` returns a `Promise`, and a browser event handler cannot block on
//! one: the write is therefore started and left to finish on its own, which is
//! exactly what a copy control needs.
//!
//! `navigator.clipboard` is **not always there**. Safari — desktop and mobile —
//! only defines it in a secure context, so a page served over plain HTTP, such
//! as a phone opening a development server by IP address, has the property
//! missing altogether. web-sys' getter is structural and hands back an
//! `undefined` wearing [`web_sys::Clipboard`]'s clothes, so calling `writeText`
//! on it throws `undefined is not an object` out of Wasm. Every write therefore
//! checks the property before touching it and falls back to
//! `document.execCommand("copy")`, which is the only path that works there.
//!
//! Reading is the awkward direction. `readText` is asynchronous *and*
//! permission-gated, so there is nothing to return synchronously except the
//! text this process wrote last — kept here for that reason. A clipboard filled
//! by another page or another application is not readable from a synchronous
//! call, and [`super::get_text`] reports that as
//! [`super::ClipboardError::Unsupported`].
