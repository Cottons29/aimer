//! The system clipboard, on every platform Aimer ships.
//!
//! One pair of calls — [`set_text`] and [`get_text`] — is backed by the
//! platform's own pasteboard: `arboard` on macOS, Windows and Linux,
//! `UIPasteboard` on iOS, `android.content.ClipboardManager` through JNI on
//! Android, and the asynchronous `navigator.clipboard` on the web.
//!
//! Every call returns a [`Result`], because a clipboard is a shared system
//! resource that can legitimately be missing: a Linux session without a display
//! server, a browser that denies permission, an Android process whose activity
//! has gone away. Nothing here panics, and nothing here blocks the platform's
//! UI thread.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use aimer_native::clipboard;
//!
//! // Both calls are fallible; a widget usually just ignores the failure.
//! let _ = clipboard::set_text("copied from Aimer");
//! ```
//!
//! # Web
//!
//! The browser clipboard is asynchronous and permission-gated. [`set_text`]
//! starts the write and returns immediately, which is what a pointer or key
//! handler needs. Where `navigator.clipboard` is missing altogether — Safari
//! outside a secure context, which is any page served over plain HTTP — the
//! write goes through `document.execCommand("copy")` instead, so a copy control
//! keeps working rather than throwing. [`get_text`] cannot block on a `Promise`
//! and therefore returns the text this process wrote last, or
//! [`ClipboardError::Unsupported`] when it has written none — see
//! [`get_text`]'s own documentation.
