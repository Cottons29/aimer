//! A thread-local free-list allocator for heap-mode payloads.
//!
//! A retained widget or element tree is rebuilt many times per second and
//! most of its heap payloads share a handful of layouts. Routing those blocks
//! through the global allocator pays for a lock-free-but-not-free `malloc`
//! search on every node, every frame. This module instead recycles blocks in
//! per-size-class free lists: allocation pops a pointer, deallocation pushes
//! it back, and the global allocator only sees the first block of each class
//! and anything that does not fit a class.
//!
//! The pool is sound because [`Rubick`](crate::Rubick) is neither `Send` nor
//! `Sync`, so a payload is always freed on the thread that allocated it. The
//! free list is intrusive: a cached block stores the next pointer in its own
//! first word, so the pool itself needs no auxiliary allocation.
