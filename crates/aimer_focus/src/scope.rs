/// Confines keyboard focus to one region of the application while it is held.
///
/// A trap exists because a modal is a *mode*: while a dialog is presented, the
/// text field behind it must stop receiving text, `Tab` must not walk into the
/// application underneath, and closing the dialog must give focus back to
/// whatever had it before. Aimer presents overlays through their own dispatch
/// root — the content of a modal is not part of the element tree it covers — so
/// confinement cannot be expressed as a subtree restriction. It is expressed
/// here instead, as a thread-local stack of regions: the innermost held trap is
/// the [active](active_focus_trap) one, and a [`crate::FocusManager`] that
/// belongs to any other region [suspends](crate::FocusManager::set_trap)
/// itself, remembering its owner so it can be restored.
///
/// The trap is released when the guard is dropped, which is what makes it safe:
/// an overlay that is torn down — dismissed, animated out, or dropped by a
/// panic while unwinding — cannot leave focus confined to a region that no
/// longer exists.
///
/// Traps may be released out of order. A dialog that opens a second dialog and
/// is then itself dismissed first leaves the second one trapping, exactly as it
/// still appears on screen.

/// let dialog = FocusTrap::acquire();

///
/// // A nested overlay takes over confinement while it is held.
/// let nested = FocusTrap::acquire();
/// assert_eq!(active_focus_trap(), Some(nested.id()));
