//! Confining keyboard focus to one part of the widget tree.
//!
//! A dialog, a drawer or a wizard step is a *mode*: while it is up, `Tab` must
//! cycle inside it and a field behind it must not be reachable at all. Wrapping
//! that region in a [`FocusScope`] is the whole of the declaration — see the
//! type's documentation for the semantics and for what happens when the scope
//! goes away.

/// Confines keyboard focus to its subtree while it traps.
///
/// A focus scope changes nothing about layout or painting: it wraps a region and
/// declares that, while it is in the tree, only the focusable targets *inside*
/// it may own the keyboard. `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` therefore cycle within the
/// scope instead of walking out into the application behind it, and no element
/// outside it can be given focus — which is exactly what a dialog rendered
/// inline needs, and what distinguishes a mode from an ordinary panel.
///
/// Entering a scope remembers whatever owned focus outside it, and leaving the
/// scope — dismissed, navigated away from, or simply rebuilt out of the tree —
/// gives focus back to it if it is still there. Nothing has to be restored by
/// hand.
///
/// Scopes nest: the innermost trapping scope is the one that confines focus, so
/// a dialog inside a drawer traps within the dialog, and closing it hands the
/// keyboard back to the drawer.
///
/// A scope that does not [trap](FocusScope::traps) is inert, which is what makes
/// the flag worth having: a widget that is sometimes a mode — a panel that
/// becomes modal on a small screen — keeps one build path and flips a `bool`.
///
/// Overlays presented through `aimer_modal` need no scope. Their content is not
/// part of the tree they cover, so they confine focus with an
/// [`aimer_focus::FocusTrap`] instead; the effect for the application underneath
/// is the same.
///
/// # Examples

/// ```
/// use aimer_widget::FocusScope;
///
/// struct Dialog;
/// # impl aimer_widget::Widget for Dialog {
/// #     fn to_element(self, _ctx: &aimer_widget::base::BuildContext) -> aimer_widget::AnyElement {
/// #         unreachable!("this example only builds the widget")
/// #     }
/// # }
///
/// // While this is in the tree, Tab cannot leave the dialog.
/// let modal = FocusScope::new().child(Dialog);
///
/// // The same region, not confining anything.
/// let inline = FocusScope::new().traps(false).child(Dialog);
