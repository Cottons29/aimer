//! Rebuilding the widgets that read the window metrics, and only those.
//!
//! A window drag delivers a resize event for every pixel the edge travels. The
//! frame that answers it has to lay the tree out again — the constraints
//! genuinely changed — but almost nothing has to be *built* again: a widget
//! whose `build` never looked at the window is described by exactly the same
//! configuration it was described by before the drag started.
//!
//! Widgets that do look — through `MediaQuery` or
//! [`BuildContext::watch_window_metrics`](crate::base::BuildContext::watch_window_metrics)
//! — register here while they build, exactly the way a widget watching a
//! provider registers with it. A resize then marks that handful of widgets dirty
//! instead of walking the whole tree flipping every dirty flag, which is the
//! difference between a drag that tracks the cursor and one that does not.
//!
//! Most widgets do not depend on the window itself but on one question about it
//! — "is this narrow enough to stack the columns?" — whose answer changes at a
//! single point in a whole drag.
//! [`BuildContext::select_window_metrics`](crate::base::BuildContext::select_window_metrics)
//! registers that question instead of the metrics, so the widget is rebuilt when
//! the answer changes and left alone for every other pixel.
//!
//! Registration lasts for one build. The next build of the same widget clears it
//! and re-registers whatever that build reads, so a widget that stops consulting
//! the window stops paying for it.
