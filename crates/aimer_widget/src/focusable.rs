/// Makes its child a keyboard focus target.
///
/// A focusable region is one that offers a [`FocusNode`] to the framework. That
/// single offer is the whole of the contract: a press that lands on the region
/// moves focus to it, `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` stop at it in tree order, keyboard
/// events are delivered to it while it owns focus, and a press that lands on
/// nothing focusable takes focus away again. Everything else this widget does is
/// handing layout, painting and events straight through to the child.
///
/// # Why it has state
///
/// A focus target *is* its node, and widgets are rebuilt constantly — including
/// as a result of the focus change itself, when a handler calls `set_state` to
/// draw a border. A region that made a fresh node on every build would be a
/// different target each time and would lose focus the moment anything above it
/// changed. The node is therefore created once, in the state, and every rebuild
/// hands the same one back.
///
/// The child is retained for the same reason, through a [`ChildBuilder`]: a
/// rebuild reaches the child's *element* again instead of building another one,
/// so a text field inside a focusable card keeps its text when the card is
/// focused.
///
/// # Choosing a behavior
///
/// [`FocusBehavior`] decides whether the region is offered at all and whether it
/// asks for focus on arrival; see its documentation for the table. The default
/// is [`FocusBehavior::OnPress`].
///
/// # Observing focus
///
/// [`on_focus`](Self::on_focus) and [`on_focus_lost`](Self::on_focus_lost)
/// report one edge each; [`on_focus_change`](Self::on_focus_change) reports both
/// with a `bool`, which is usually what a handler that flips an appearance
/// wants. All three are notifications rather than requests: they never consume
/// the event, so a focusable region nested inside another still hears about its
/// own focus.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// A region that draws a border while it owns the keyboard, driven by the
/// application's own state:
///
/// ```ignore
/// Focusable::new()
///     .on_focus_change(move |focused| updater.set_state(move |s| s.focused = focused))
///     .child(Container::new().box_decoration(decoration(self.focused)).child(body))
/// ```
///
/// A region an application also drives by hand, by keeping the node itself:
///
/// ```ignore
/// // in the state
/// let node = FocusNode::new();
///
/// // in the build
/// Focusable::new().node(node.clone()).child(body)
///
/// // from anywhere, later
/// node.request_focus();
/// ```
