//! A compositor animation changes a retained node's transform, opacity or clip
//! and nothing a build, layout or paint pass reads. Walking the whole element
//! tree to sample it therefore costs O(tree) for work that is O(animations).
//!
//! The first walk after anything else changed is a full one. Each element that
//! applies an active compositor animation during it leaves a copy of the
//! context its parents gave it here. While nothing else asks for a frame and no
//! generation has moved, the frame loop calls [`animation_only_targets`] and
//! [`run_animation_only_pass`] instead of walking the tree: each registered
//! element is revisited alone, with that context, and its subtree is left
//! alone.
