//! Which part of the element tree an advance of the tree generation touched.
//!
//! [`element_tree_generation`] says that *something* about the retained tree
//! changed, which is all a consumer can learn from it: it must assume the whole
//! tree did. Most advances are not that large. A rebuild replaces the child of
//! one stateful element with an equivalent subtree and leaves every element
//! outside it exactly where it was.
//!
//! The reconciliation that performs such a replacement records the root of the
//! subtree here, and advances only the *scoped* count. Anything else that moves
//! the generation (a hosted child added, a tree changed in a way no single root
//! describes) advances the *unscoped* count instead. A consumer that last saw
//! the tree at unscoped generation `g` and finds it still at `g` knows every
//! change since was one of the recorded subtree replacements, and may revisit
//! just those subtrees.
