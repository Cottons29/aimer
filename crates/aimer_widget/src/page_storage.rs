//! Framework-level `PageStorage` — a keyed store that outlives the widget
//! subtree.
//!
//! A window resize (or a tab swap, an `if/else` branch flip, an unmounted list
//! item) rebuilds and can fully tear down everything under a `Scrollable`,
//! re-running each nested `StatefulWidget::create_state()`. Reconciliation
//! carry only preserves state when the *old* element still exists to copy from,
//! so it cannot survive a full teardown.
//!
//! The framework already solves this for scroll position with a private,
//! scroll-only `thread_local` map (`aimer_container`'s `scroll_storage`). This
//! is the same mechanism, generalized and made public so **any** stateful
//! widget can persist **any** value across a rebuild by parking it here —
//! without each widget declaring its own `thread_local!`. It is Flutter's
//! `PageStorage`.
//!
//! Usage — two lines, no per-widget `thread_local!`:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use aimer::page_storage;
//!
//! // in create_state(): re-seed from the store instead of a hardcoded default
//! let current_index = page_storage::read_or("same-looking-tab", 0usize);
//!
//! // in the event handler that changes it: write through so a later rebuild restores it
//! page_storage::write("same-looking-tab", index);
//! ```
//!
//! ponytail: the render pipeline is single-threaded, so this is a
//! `thread_local` map with no lock — mirroring `scroll_storage`. Values are
//! type-erased (`Box<dyn Any>`); a `read::<T>` for the wrong `T` returns `None`
//! rather than panicking. Entries are never evicted, so an app that churns
//! through unbounded unique keys grows this map without limit. Upgrade path:
//! evict on an explicit dispose hook, or cap it with an LRU (same ceiling as
//! `scroll_storage`).
