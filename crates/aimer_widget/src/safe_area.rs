//! The part of the window the system keeps for itself, and the widgets that
//! stay out of it.
//!
//! A window is not always fully usable. iOS draws the status bar, the notch and
//! the home indicator *over* the application's surface; Android does the same
//! with its status and navigation bars and a display cutout; a browser tab on a
//! notched phone exposes the same region through the `env(safe-area-inset-*)`
//! CSS variables. Content painted there is still visible, but a touch landing
//! on it belongs to the system — which is why a panel placed under the status
//! bar cannot be pressed at all.
//!
//! The platform layer reports the region through [`set_safe_area_insets`], in
//! logical pixels measured inwards from each edge of the window. Everything
//! that positions itself against the window rather than against a parent —
//! [`crate::window_metrics`]' readers, floating panels, context menus — asks for
//! it here.
//!
//! Widgets that read the insets while building are rebuilt when they change,
//! and only those; the contract, the registration lifetime and the cost are
//! exactly [`crate::platform_brightness`]'.
