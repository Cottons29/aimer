/// A child subtree its parent may place into the tree, any number of times.
///
/// # Why a parent needs one
///
/// A widget describes configuration and is *consumed* by the build that turns it
/// into an element, so a plain child value can serve exactly one build. That is
/// enough for a container, which is rebuilt by its own parent and therefore
/// receives a fresh child widget every time, but not for a widget that rebuilds
/// *itself*: a button rebuilds on hover and press, a scrollable on every offset
/// change, a theme on every tick of its transition. Each of those rebuilds needs
/// the child's element again, and a consumed widget cannot produce a second one.
///
/// Reproducing the widget is not available either — cloning it would need a
/// [`Clone`] bound the tree does not have, since an erased child is not `Clone`
/// — so the child is **retained** instead. The first build consumes the widget
/// and keeps the element it produced; every later build hands the tree a thin
/// proxy over that same element. A self-rebuilding parent therefore does not
/// rebuild its subtree at all, which is strictly cheaper than rebuilding it on
/// every hover.
///
/// # Identity
///
/// Reconciliation matches an old element to a new one by [`Widget::key`], and
/// diagnostics name a node by [`Widget::debug_name`]. Both are copied out of the
/// widget before it is stored, and the proxy reports the retained element's own
/// key and name, so a child reached through a slot keeps the identity it had
/// when it was reached directly.
///
/// # Invariant
///
/// One `ChildBuilder` describes **one position** in the tree. Cloning it is a
/// reference-count bump, which is what lets a state carry it across the rebuilds
/// of its parent, but placing two clones in two different positions would put
/// the same element in the tree twice and is a misuse.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use aimer_widget::{ChildBuilder, ErrorWidget};
///
/// let child = ChildBuilder::from_widget(ErrorWidget::new("missing route"));
///
/// // The builder is a widget itself, so it can be handed to any parent, and
/// // it reports the name of the widget it was made from.
/// assert_eq!(aimer_widget::Widget::debug_name(&child), "ErrorWidget");
