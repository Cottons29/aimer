/// A single-child box the user resizes by dragging its edges or corners.
///
/// The widget owns its size: [`Resizable::width`] and [`Resizable::height`] give
/// the size it starts at, and every drag replaces it. The size survives rebuilds
/// of the widget, so a parent that rebuilds for unrelated reasons does not snap
/// the box back to where it started.
///
/// A band along each edge is a grab zone: it reaches
/// [`Resizable::handle_thickness`] logical pixels into the box and
/// [`Resizable::handle_outset`] pixels out of it, so the pointer arriving at the
/// border is already on the handle. The four overlaps are corner zones that
/// resize both axes at once. [`Resizable::direction`] picks which of the eight
/// are live — all of them by default. While the pointer is over a live one the
/// window shows the matching resize cursor ([`ResizeHandle::cursor`]), and it
/// returns to the platform default on the way out. The press takes the pointer,
/// so the drag keeps running once the cursor leaves the widget, and it stops on
/// release.
///
/// The parent decides where the widget sits, so a resize changes the size alone:
/// dragging the left or top edge outwards asks for more space, but the box grows
/// from its fixed top-left corner. See [`ResizeHandle::resize`].
///
/// The child is laid out inside the current size and clipped to it, so shrinking
/// the box hides the overflow rather than letting it spill.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// A panel the user can widen, between 120 and 480 logical pixels:
///
/// ```
/// use aimer_container::{Container, Resizable};
///
/// let panel = Resizable::new()
///     .width(240.0)
///     .height(320.0)
///     .min_width(120.0)
///     .max_width(480.0)
///     .child(Container::new().child(aimer_container::ZeroSizedBox));
