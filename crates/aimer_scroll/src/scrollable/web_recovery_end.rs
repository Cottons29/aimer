/// Closes a web scroll gesture the moment its bouncy edge has recovered.
///
/// A browser never reports a lift, so the platform layer keeps a synthesized
/// gesture open for as long as `wheel` events keep arriving — including the
/// momentum tail the browser delivers on its own after the fingers left the
/// trackpad. Once the stretched edge has sprung back the gesture is over from
/// the user's point of view, but that tail is still in flight: every remaining
/// delta pushes the content past the edge again and the viewport bounces a
/// second time, seconds after the flick.
///
/// This tracker watches the drawn frames for the recovery finishing and, on
/// that single frame, asks the caller to terminate the gesture with a
/// [`TouchPhase::Ended`] scroll frame. Everything the browser still delivers
/// for that gesture is then dropped, until the user pushes again (contact
/// returns) or the platform opens a new gesture with a fresh phase.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// let end = WebRecoveryEnd::new();
///
/// // Frames while the spring pulls the edge back.
/// assert!(!end.observe_frame(true, false));
/// // The frame the content lands on its edge closes the gesture, once.
/// assert!(end.observe_frame(false, false));
/// assert!(!end.observe_frame(false, false));
///
/// // Once the terminating frame is delivered, what the browser still has
/// // queued no longer reaches the content.
/// end.drain_tail();
/// assert!(end.drops_frame(false, TouchPhase::Moved));
/// // A renewed push takes over again.
/// assert!(!end.drops_frame(true, TouchPhase::Moved));
