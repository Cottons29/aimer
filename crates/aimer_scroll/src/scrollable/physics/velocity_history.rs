//! Time-aware record of how fast a pointer drag was moving.
//!
//! A release fling is only as good as the speed it is launched with, and that
//! speed is a property of a *moment*: the instant the finger left the glass.
//! A drag that races across the viewport and then eases to a standstill before
//! the lift must launch nothing at all, even though the very same gesture was
//! moving fast a fraction of a second earlier.
//!
//! [`VelocityHistory`] therefore records every drag sample together with the
//! wall-clock slice it describes and answers with the average speed over the
//! last [`VELOCITY_HORIZON_S`] seconds only — total travel divided by total
//! time, the physical definition of a velocity. Samples older than the horizon
//! belong to an earlier part of the gesture and are simply not asked.
//!
//! The duration weighting matters as much as the horizon: pointer moves do not
//! arrive on a fixed cadence (a browser coalesces a burst of them into one
//! dispatch, a native host delivers one per frame), so a plain mean over the
//! last *n* samples would let a handful of dense, fast samples outvote the
//! long, slow slice that actually ended the gesture.
