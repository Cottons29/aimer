//! The margin by which a scroll viewport prepares content it cannot yet show.
//!
//! A viewport hands its child the rectangle the child is expected to
//! materialize. Handing down the *exact* viewport makes that rectangle a
//! perfect culling contract — and puts a line's entire cost (build, layout,
//! shaping, syntax highlighting, glyph rasterization) on the single frame its
//! top edge crosses the boundary. That frame is the pause the user feels.
//!
//! A cache extent widens the rectangle so the work happens a few frames before
//! the content is needed. It is the spatial counterpart of the index-based
//! overscan a lazy list already keeps, and it is why the widened rectangle is
//! biased: content is only ever needed on the side the viewport is travelling
//! toward, so a margin large enough for a fling would be wasted on the side
//! left behind.
//!
//! Nothing here allocates or branches on state — it is a pure function of the
//! viewport and how far it moved last frame, so the caller can compute it
//! every frame.
