//! The furniture a selection grows: two draggable knobs and a callout.
//!
//! A selection that can only be made, never adjusted, and only acted on through
//! a keyboard is a desktop selection. This module adds the other half — the two
//! blue handles at its ends and the floating menu above it — as state on the
//! [`SelectionSession`] plus one painter and one event interceptor.
//!
//! **The interceptor runs before the text does.** Both live *on top of* the
//! glyphs, so a press that grabbed a knob or tapped `Copy` would otherwise be
//! taken by the paragraph underneath and start a brand-new selection. Every
//! participant, and the region itself, therefore offers each pointer event to
//! [`intercept`] first and only handles what it gives back.
//!
//! **Neither the callout nor the knobs are painted by the region.** Both stand
//! clear of the selection — the callout floats above it, and each knob hangs
//! outside the line it marks — so every ancestor that clips, a `Scrollable`
//! above all, would cut them off. The callout is an
//! [`aimer_ctxmenu::ContextMenu`] presented through the modal host; the knobs go
//! through the same host's [`OverlayLayer`], which paints above every widget and
//! receives no events. See [`track_handles`].
//!
//! **What paints outside an element must be claimed by it.** Routing hit-tests,
//! so a region reporting only the box its text painted is a region whose knobs
//! cannot be pressed: the press lands on whatever encloses it instead, and a
//! scroll view reads it as a scroll. Every element that offers events to
//! [`intercept`] therefore grows its own box by [`hit_bounds_with_handles`].
//!
//! **The shape of the callout is the pointer's choice, not the platform's.** A
//! finger gets the pill floating above the selection; a right-click gets the
//! desktop list opening at the click. That is [`ContextMenuShape::for_source`]
//! deciding, so a phone browser and a desktop browser each behave the way their
//! user expects.
//!
//! Knob placement lives in [`super::handles`], which knows nothing about
//! sessions, canvases or events; the menu lives in `aimer_ctxmenu`; what is
//! left here is the state machine tying the two to a selection.
