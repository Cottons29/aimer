//! The hold a finger must complete before it starts selecting text.
//!
//! A mouse press means exactly one thing, so it selects at once. A finger press
//! does not: the same gesture starts a scroll, a fling, a tap on a link and a
//! selection, and only what happens next tells them apart. Selecting
//! immediately would therefore steal every scroll that began on top of a
//! paragraph — which is most of them.
//!
//! So a touch press is *recorded* rather than acted upon, and it is left
//! unconsumed so an enclosing scrollable can still claim it. Only once the
//! finger has rested for [`TOUCH_SELECTION_HOLD`] without wandering further
//! than [`TOUCH_SELECTION_SLOP`] does the press become a selection — the same
//! rule [`aimer_dnd`](https://docs.rs/aimer_dnd) applies to a touch drag.
//!
//! Resting is judged against the *text*, not against the window: the press
//! records where the paragraph was painted, and a paragraph that has since
//! travelled further than [`TOUCH_SELECTION_SLOP`] gives the press up. A finger
//! cannot be holding still on content that is moving, and this is what keeps the
//! scrolls that move a page without ever reporting a finger move — a touch
//! browser's scroll deltas, momentum, an animation — from selecting a word half
//! a second in.
//!
//! Like the gesture recognizers in `aimer_input`, everything here is pure with
//! respect to time: nothing reads the clock, so a five-hundred-millisecond
//! threshold is exercised by handing in an instant rather than by sleeping.
