//! A bounded map that discards the entries it has gone longest without being
//! asked for.
//!
//! The caches in front of text measurement are keyed by the string itself, so a
//! scrolled list of a hundred thousand distinct rows will always ask for keys the
//! cache has never seen. A cache that reacts to being full by emptying itself
//! then throws away the handful of entries the current frame is built from, and
//! every newly visible row becomes a guaranteed miss for the rest of the
//! session. Evicting the coldest entries instead keeps what is on screen.
//!
//! Eviction happens in batches: when the map is full, a quarter of it is dropped
//! at once. A batch costs `O(len)`, but it frees `capacity / 4` slots, so the
//! amortized cost per insertion stays constant — and unlike an intrusive
//! linked-list LRU it needs no extra allocation per entry and no `unsafe`.
