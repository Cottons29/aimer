//! The in-process retained compositor scene.

//! The scene is the immutable frame transaction lowered from Aimer's retained

//! damage footprints, and the command/surface payload ranges that the renderer
//! can consume without walking widgets again. Ordinary commands remain in
//! [`crate::draw_cmd::DrawList`] as the safe payload fallback; promoted content
//! is represented by renderer-owned surfaces and composed directly when its
//! pixels are unchanged.
