//! Grouping of fresh glyphs into the units one scaler draws.
//!
//! Turning a glyph into coverage is preceded by work that belongs to the
//! *face at a size*, not to the glyph: mapping the font file, parsing its
//! tables, building the scaler and its hinting instance, and reading the
//! metrics the advances come from. Asking for one glyph at a time pays all of
//! it once per glyph. Asking for a run of glyphs that share a face and a size
//! pays it once for the run.
//!
//! Runs are also the unit of parallelism, so they are capped: a page of text
//! is usually one face at one size, and a single unbounded run would leave
//! every worker but one idle.
