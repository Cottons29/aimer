//! Dynamic system font discovery on Apple platforms.
//!
//! macOS and iOS ship their font catalogue behind Core Text rather than a
//! directory that can be enumerated cheaply. Walking every installed face —
//! which is what generic font databases do — costs hundreds of milliseconds at
//! startup and keeps large CJK and emoji faces resident in memory, so Cupid
//! instead asks Core Text four narrow questions:
//!
//! * [`system_font_path`] — "where does the family called *X* live?"
//! * [`fallback_font_path_for_probes`] — "which face would you use to draw
//!   these codepoints?"
//! * [`font_paths_for_codepoint`] — "which faces *could* draw this character?"
//! * [`language_fallback_sources`] — "which face would each UI language's
//!   cascade use to draw these codepoints?"
//!
//! Most answers are file system paths. The caller memory-maps those files,
//! which keeps the bytes out of the heap and lets the kernel evict them under
//! pressure. A face that no readable file backs is instead reassembled from
//! the tables Core Graphics exposes for it — `CTFontCopyGraphicsFont` followed
//! by `CGFontCopyTableTags`/`CGFontCopyTableForTag` — so Cupid can still
//! rasterize it without the platform's off-screen layer.
//!
//! Core Text's preferred answer is not always usable by the owned
//! rasterizer: on recent macOS builds the system UI cascade resolves CJK to
//! `PingFangUI.ttc`, a private file whose faces expose neither `glyf` outlines
//! nor bitmap strikes, so rendering it produces blank glyphs. This is why
//! [`font_paths_for_codepoint`] returns a *list* — the caller validates the
//! candidates in order and keeps the first one it can actually draw.
//!
//! The bindings come from [`objc2_core_text`] and [`objc2_core_foundation`].
//! Every Core Text object is returned as a [`CFRetained`] handle, so ownership
//! follows the Core Foundation *Create Rule* automatically and no manual
//! `CFRelease` is needed.
//!
//! This module is compiled only with the `apple-core-text` feature. The
//! platform bridge supplies discovery and table extraction; glyph lookup,
//! shaping, and rasterization remain owned by Cupid's Aimer font engine.
//!
