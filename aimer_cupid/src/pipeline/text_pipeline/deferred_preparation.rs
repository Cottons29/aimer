//! Which text a frame owes the screen, and how much of the rest it can afford.
//!
//! A scroll viewport hands its child a rectangle wider than the viewport, so a
//! line is built, laid out, shaped and rasterized a few frames before it
//! scrolls in rather than on the single frame its edge crosses the boundary.
//! That moves the work; it does not remove it. During a sustained fling fresh
//! content arrives every frame, so preparing the whole widened rectangle
//! unconditionally turns one visible stall into a continuous one.
//!
//! What makes the widened rectangle safe is that, by definition, **nothing on
//! screen depends on the part of it that is off screen**. Dropping a visible
//! glyph shows blank text; dropping one that is clipped away shows nothing at
//! all. This module is that asymmetry: [`request_is_on_screen`] says which
//! side of it a request falls on, and [`PreparationBudget`] says when the
//! frame has spent enough on the other side.
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function of geometry and of a clock the caller
//! passes in, so the policy is testable without a GPU and without sleeping.
