//! On-demand system font fallback, resolved one codepoint at a time.
//!
//! A pre-built fallback chain has to guess which faces the application will
//! need before it has seen a single character. The usual way to guess is a
//! table of script samples, but a face selected by a sample only guarantees
//! coverage of that sample: a Japanese face picked for `漢` has no glyph for
//! `你`, and no sample at all is taken for punctuation such as `！`, so those
//! characters end up drawn as `.notdef` boxes.
//!
//! This module removes the guess. When no already-loaded face covers a
//! codepoint, the platform is asked which face draws *that* codepoint, the
//! answer is memory-mapped, and it becomes part of the fallback set. Nothing
//! is loaded for text the application never renders.
//!
//! # Stable font ids
//!
//! Text preparation is parallel: shaping, layout and rasterization run in
//! separate [`GlyphRasterizer`] copies created from a shared snapshot, and a
//! glyph is handed between them as a `(font id, glyph id)` pair. A font id
//! assigned locally by whichever worker happened to resolve the codepoint
//! first would therefore mean different faces in different workers.
//!
//! The store lives process-wide instead: a face is identified by its
//! `(path, collection index)` pair and keeps one id for the lifetime of the
//! process, so every worker resolving the same codepoint observes the same id.
//! Ids start at [`SYSTEM_FALLBACK_ID_BASE`], which keeps them clear of the
//! per-script platform-independent lanes and of fonts registered at runtime.
//!
//! [`GlyphRasterizer`]: crate::text_pipeline::glyph_rasterizer::GlyphRasterizer
//!
//! On Apple, the discovery and private-glyph compatibility path is available
//! only with the `apple-core-text` feature. Without it, this module leaves
//! unsupported system faces unresolved so the portable profile cannot invoke
//! Core Text implicitly.
