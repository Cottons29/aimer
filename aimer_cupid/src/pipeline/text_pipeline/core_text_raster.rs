//! Glyph rasterization performed by the system on Apple platforms.
//!
//! Cupid rasterizes glyphs itself: outlines come from `glyf` or `CFF `, color
//! artwork from `sbix`, `CBDT` or `COLR`. Apple's own system fonts do not
//! always use those formats. Two of them are load bearing on iOS:
//!
//! * `PingFangUI.ttc` — the only face on the system covering Simplified
//!   Chinese — stores its outlines in a private `hvgl` table and ships neither
//!   `glyf` nor `CFF `;
//! * `AppleColorEmoji-160px.ttc` stores its `sbix` strikes as `emjc`, Apple's
//!   compressed emoji format, where the macOS build of the same font uses
//!   plain `png `.
//!
//! Every table needed to *shape* text is present in both — `cmap`, `hmtx`,
//! `GSUB`, `morx` — only the pixels are unreachable, so shaping, measurement
//! and layout stay with Cupid and just the final rasterization is handed to
//! Core Text, which is the only code that can read these formats.
//!
//! # Glyph identity
//!
//! A [`RasterizedGlyph`] is addressed by glyph id, and glyph ids are per face:
//! asking Core Text for the wrong face of a collection would draw a different
//! character. The face is therefore selected by PostScript name — read from
//! the very face Cupid shaped with — and the collection index is used only
//! when the file exposes no name to match on.
//!
//! # Weight
//!
//! Apple's variable system faces default to a heavier instance than the one
//! their own cascade pairs with regular text, so a variable face is pinned
//! before drawing — to the weight the caller's glyph key asks for, which the
//! fallback pipeline derives from the run's style and from the faces standing
//! beside the glyph. [`NORMAL_TEXT_WEIGHT`] is the neutral request.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! Building a `CTFont` parses the file, so fonts are cached per
//! `(file, face, size, weight)`. The cache is thread local, which keeps it
//! lock free and matches how text preparation runs: each worker owns its
//! rasterizer.
//! Everything downstream — the atlas, the bitmap cache, the metrics store —
//! is unaware that the pixels came from the platform.
//!
//! This module is compiled only with the `apple-core-text` compatibility
//! feature. It is deliberately outside the portable Aimer rasterizer.
