//! Small, allocation-free Unicode script classifier used by the owned text
//! pipeline.
//!
//! The renderer only needs a script identity to keep shaping runs apart. It
//! does not need a complete Unicode property database here: the Aimer layout
//! dispatcher owns the detailed script checks and returns a checked fallback
//! result for scripts outside its supported shaping slices. Keeping this
//! classifier local removes a font-engine dependency from the hot run-building
//! path while retaining the important invariant that, for example, Khmer and
//! Latin are never shaped as one run.
