//! The per-frame gate that skips instance uploads whose bytes are already in
//! the GPU buffer.

use bytemuck::Pod;

/// Decides whether a frame's instance data must be written to its GPU buffer.
///
/// Cupid re-records the draw list every frame, so each pipeline rebuilds its
/// instance vector even when nothing on screen moved. Writing that vector to
/// the GPU anyway costs a staging-buffer allocation and a blit per
/// [`wgpu::Queue::write_buffer`] — on a mostly static frame these redundant
/// uploads dominate the CPU encode time. `FrameUpload` remembers the bytes
/// that were last written to the buffer, letting the pipeline skip the write
/// when the new frame's bytes are already there.
///
/// # Contract
///
/// One `FrameUpload` guards exactly one buffer, and every guarded write must
/// start at offset zero — which is how Cupid's pipelines upload since the
/// whole frame's instances travel in a single write. Whenever the buffer is
/// recreated (grown or shrunk by its size policy), call [`invalidate`] so the
/// next frame writes unconditionally.
///
/// A skipped upload relies on the destination buffer retaining its contents
/// between frames, which `wgpu` guarantees for a buffer that is not
/// reallocated.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// let mut gate = FrameUpload::new();
/// // Frame 1: fresh gate, the bytes must go up.
/// assert!(gate.needs_upload(&instances));
/// gate.mark_uploaded(&instances);
/// // Frame 2: same scene, same bytes — nothing to do.
/// assert!(!gate.needs_upload(&instances));
