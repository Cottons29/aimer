//! Native Metal backend.
//!
//! Enabled by the `metal` feature, which implies the `GpuBackend` gate and
//! resolves only on Apple targets, where `objc2-metal` is declared as a
//! target dependency.
//!
//! # Shader source
//!
//! [`GpuBackend::create_shader_module`] receives an opaque byte blob and each
//! backend interprets it in its own native language: `WgpuBackend` reads WGSL,
//! this backend reads MSL. A pipeline that runs on both must supply the source
//! matching its backend.
//!
//! # Thread safety
//!
//! Metal documents device, queue, buffer, texture, sampler, library and
//! pipeline-state objects as usable from any thread, so the resource newtypes
//! are `Send + Sync`, matching the assertion `wgpu`'s own Metal backend makes
//! for the same objects. A recording render pass is deliberately *not*: a
//! command encoder belongs to the thread recording into it.
//!
//! # Deferred
//!
//! Buffers are always allocated `MTLStorageModeShared`. GPU-only buffers would
//! prefer `Private` and CPU-written ones prefer write-combined caching; both
//! are allocation-policy refinements, and tuning this path is out of scope for
//! the backend's introduction.
