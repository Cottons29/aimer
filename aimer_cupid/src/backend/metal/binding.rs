//! Mapping from the renderer's `(group, binding)` bind-group model onto
//! Metal's per-stage argument tables.
//!
//! Metal has no bind groups. Instead each shader stage has three independent
//! argument tables — buffers, textures, and samplers — addressed by a single
//! integer each. The trait hands the backend `(group, binding)` pairs, so a
//! Metal backend must flatten them, and the flattening rule has to be knowable
//! by three parties that never talk to each other:
//!
//! 1. the hand-written MSL, where every bound resource carries an explicit
//!    `[[buffer(N)]]` / `[[texture(N)]]` / `[[sampler(N)]]`;
//! 2. [`super::MetalBackend`]'s `set_bind_group`, which issues the
//!    `setVertexBuffer:offset:atIndex:` family; and
//! 3. the vertex streams, because `setVertexBuffer:atIndex:` writes into the
//!    *same* table as buffer arguments, so a vertex stream and a uniform bound
//!    at the same index silently alias.
//!
//! The rule is deliberately a pure function of the group index rather than an
//! accumulation across the pipeline layout, because the trait's
//! `create_bind_group` only receives the layout it was built from and never
//! learns which group index it will be bound at. A pure function means the MSL
//! side can hard-code indices without a build step.
//!
//! Vertex streams are placed at the top of the buffer table and counted
//! downward, which keeps them clear of the argument range for any group count
//! the renderer uses today (at most two) and any binding count per group (at
//! most three).
