//! A child a parent can hand to the tree more than once.
//!
//! A consuming [`Widget::to_element`] serves exactly one build, which is all a
//! container needs: a container is rebuilt by *its* parent, so it receives a
//! fresh child widget every time. A widget that rebuilds *itself* is the hard
//! case — a button on hover, a viewport on a new offset, a theme on every tick
//! of its transition — because its child widget was already consumed by the
//! first build and cannot answer a second one.
//!
//! Reproducing the widget is not available: cloning it would require a `Clone`
//! bound the tree does not have (an erased child is not `Clone`), and asking
//! the caller for a factory would change `child(widget)` into
//! `child(|| widget)` at every call site.
//!
//! So the child is *retained* instead. The first build consumes the widget and
//! keeps the element it produced; every later build hands the tree a thin proxy
//! over that same element. The subtree is therefore not rebuilt at all when its
//! parent rebuilds itself, which is strictly cheaper than the borrowing
//! conversion it replaces — that one re-ran the whole subtree on every hover.
