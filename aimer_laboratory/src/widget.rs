//! The short-lived side of the tree.

//! A widget is a description of configuration built inside `build`, turned
//! into an element on the next line, and dropped immediately afterwards.
//! Nothing else ever reads it. That is the whole justification for the
//! consuming signature below: a value about to be destroyed has no reason to
//! be copied first.

/// A configuration value that produces exactly one element.
///
/// # Consuming conversion
///
/// [`Widget::to_element`] takes `self` by value. Compared with a borrowing
/// signature this changes three things:
///
/// 1. fields move into the element instead of being cloned, so a widget
///    holding a `Vec`, `String`, or any other owning field costs no
///    allocation at build time;
/// 2. a widget that wants to rebuild itself later can store *itself* in the
///    element's closure rather than a copy, which removes the implicit
///    `Clone` bound a derive would otherwise need;
/// 3. widgets no longer have to be `Clone` at all — the doc test in the crate
///    root builds a deliberately non-`Clone` widget.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use aimer_laboratory::{AnyElement, Element, Widget};
///
/// struct Spacer(f32);
///
/// struct SpacerElement(f32);
///
/// impl Element for SpacerElement {}
///
/// impl Widget for Spacer {
///     fn to_element(self) -> AnyElement {
///         AnyElement::new(SpacerElement(self.0))
///     }
/// }
///
/// assert_eq!(Spacer(8.0).boxed().debug_name(), "Unknown");
/// ```
