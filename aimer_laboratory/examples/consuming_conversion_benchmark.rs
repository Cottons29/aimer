//! Head-to-head timing of the borrowing and the consuming widget conversion.
//!
//! The allocation experiments in [`aimer_laboratory::experiment`] answer *how
//! many times a build reaches the allocator*. They do not answer *how long a
//! build takes*, and the two are not the same question: the consuming
//! conversion removes clones but adds one bit copy of the whole widget out of
//! its erased storage, so a widget owning no heap data could plausibly come out
//! slower.
//!
//! Production no longer contains the borrowing conversion, so it is
//! reconstructed here — the same erased owner, the same element type, the same
//! node shapes, and clones exactly where the old implementations cloned. Four
//! scenarios are timed:
//!
//! 1. **decorated tree** — nodes owning a `Vec`, the shape the migration
//!    targeted; the borrowing side clones the vector per node per frame.
//! 2. **scalar widget** — no heap field at all, the shape where the extra bit
//!    copy has nothing to pay for itself with.
//! 3. **pooled widget** — a payload wider than the inline budget, so the bit
//!    copy is a read out of a pooled block rather than out of the handle.
//! 4. **self-rebuilding parent** — a hover, a scroll offset, a theme tick: the
//!    borrowing side re-runs its child subtree, the consuming side places the
//!    element it already has.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p aimer_laboratory --example consuming_conversion_benchmark
//! cargo run -p aimer_laboratory --example consuming_conversion_benchmark --release
//! ```
//!
//! The two sides of a scenario are timed in **alternating** rounds rather than
//! one after the other. Measured back to back, a first run of this benchmark
//! reported the decorated tree 14% faster and the scalar widget 6.6% slower,
//! and a second run reported the exact opposite — the drift of the machine over
//! a few hundred milliseconds is larger than the effect being measured, so
//! whichever side runs second wins or loses by accident. Alternating puts both
//! sides under the same drift, and the reported minimum discards the rounds
//! that were interrupted as well as the cold round that pays for the pool. The
//! median is printed next to it: when the two disagree, the scenario is noise
//! and its verdict must not be trusted. The unit is nanoseconds per conversion.
//!
//! Each side also reports the allocations it spent per conversion, counted by a
//! recording global allocator. A timing difference the allocation counts cannot
//! explain is a measurement artefact, and an allocation difference that costs no
//! time is a statement about this machine's allocator rather than about the
//! conversion — the calibration scenario prices one allocation so the reader can
//! tell those two apart.
//!
//! # Observed
//!
//! Release profile, Apple silicon, repeated runs in agreement:
//!
//! | scenario | borrowing | consuming | verdict |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | decorated tree, per node | 41.2 ns, 2 allocs | 34.5 ns, 1 alloc | 10–16% faster |
//! | scalar widget, 16 bytes | 1.21 ns, 0 allocs | 1.22 ns, 0 allocs | no difference |
//! | 7-word widget, inline | 4.2 ns, 0 allocs | 3.6 ns, 0 allocs | 13–16% faster |
//! | 12-word widget, pooled | 6.8 ns, 0 allocs | 9.0 ns, 0 allocs | 29–39% slower |
//! | self-rebuild, per frame | 1317 ns, 64 allocs | 2.9 ns, 0 allocs | 99.8% faster |
//!
//! Three readings, in ascending order of importance.
//!
//! **The win on a heap-owning node is the allocation.** A decorated node spends
//! two allocations per build borrowing and one consuming, and the calibration
//! prices that pair at about 11 ns — which is the whole 6.7 ns/node gain once
//! the rest of the build is counted alongside it. Nothing else explains it, and
//! nothing else has to.
//!
//! **The copy the consuming conversion adds is not what costs.** That was the
//! expectation going in, and the two payload scenarios refute it: a widget of
//! 56 bytes, sitting in the handle's own storage, converts *faster* consuming
//! than borrowing, because the whole value is read out at once instead of field
//! by field through a reference. The regression appears only when the payload
//! spills out of the eight-word budget into a pooled block — then the read
//! crosses a pointer and `Rubick::take` adds its vacant-table store and its
//! release guard on top, for about 2.3 ns. So the number to tune is the inline
//! budget, not the signature.
//!
//! **The scenario that decides the migration is the last one.** A widget that
//! rebuilds itself over a retained child does not rebuild its subtree at all:
//! 64 allocations and 1.3 µs per frame become zero allocations and 3 ns. Every
//! other line on this table is a percentage; this one is three orders of
//! magnitude, and it is what a hover, a scroll frame, and a theme tick actually
//! cost now.
//!
//! The widgets above are stand-ins, and the third reading is the one that was
//! worth chasing on the real ones. `production_widget_benchmark.rs` duels the
//! shipping framework against the released pre-migration one, and when it was
//! first run a `Container` was 512 bytes against this same eight-word budget:
//! always pooled, so the decorated tree came out a wash rather than 10–16%
//! faster and the plain tree came out 40% *slower*. Packing a color into one
//! word then took `BoxDecoration` from 336 to 192 bytes and `Container` from 512
//! to 352, and both scenarios flipped to the consuming side. So the tunable is
//! the payload against the budget, exactly as the third reading says — and it is
//! tunable from either end.
