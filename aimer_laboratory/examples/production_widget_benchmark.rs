//! Head-to-head timing of the real framework, before and after the migration.
//!
//! [`consuming_conversion_benchmark`](../consuming_conversion_benchmark.rs)
//! measures the ownership model on stand-in widgets: nodes written for the
//! experiment, an element type with two methods, no build context. It answers
//! whether the *conversion* got cheaper, and it leaves one question open — what
//! the change is worth on `Container`, `Column` and `Button`, where a build also
//! resolves decoration, allocates elements out of a one-word owner, and walks a
//! `BuildContext`.
//!
//! That question needs the pre-migration framework, which no longer exists in
//! this working tree. It exists on the branch it was released from, so both are
//! dependencies here: `aimer` is the shipping consuming framework and
//! `aimer_legacy` is the same crate at `1.97.1-alpha-1`, where
//! `Widget::to_element` still took `&self` and a self-rebuilding parent still
//! held its child in an `Rc`.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p aimer_laboratory --example production_widget_benchmark --release
//! ```
//!
//! Every scenario builds the *same* tree on both sides, out of the same public
//! builders, and rebuilds the widgets each frame the way a real `build()` does —
//! the consuming side has no choice, and letting the borrowing side keep its
//! widgets would measure a program nobody writes.
//!
//! The harness is the one the sibling benchmark established: alternating rounds
//! so a machine that slows down halfway through cannot hand the verdict to
//! whichever side ran second, the minimum next to the median so a scenario that
//! disagrees with itself is reported as noise, and a recording allocator so a
//! timing difference can be checked against the allocations that should explain
//! it.
//!
//! # Observed
//!
//! Release profile, Apple silicon, repeated runs in agreement:
//!
//! | scenario | borrowing | consuming | verdict |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `SizedBox` leaf, 40 bytes | 19.6 ns, 0 allocs | 9.1 ns, 0 allocs | 52–54% faster |
//! | decorated `Container` tree, per node | 95 ns, 3 allocs | 105 ns, 2 allocs | within noise |
//! | plain `Container` tree, per node | 46.7 ns, 1 alloc | 65.1 ns, 1 alloc | 40% slower |
//! | `Column` child, per child | 14.8 ns, 0.05 allocs | 15.8 ns, 0.03 allocs | 7% slower |
//! | `Button` dirty rebuild, per frame | 4834 ns, 109 allocs | 3162 ns, 46 allocs | 35% faster |
//!
//! Four readings, in ascending order of importance.
//!
//! **A child list barely moves.** Moving each handle out of the `Vec` instead of
//! building it through a reference saves the copy of a 72-byte owner and one
//! allocation per twenty children, which is a percent or two — and the erased
//! child underneath is converted the same way on both sides, so this scenario is
//! really the container result diluted by sixty-four leaves.
//!
//! **Where a clone was removed, the copy ate the saving.** The decorated tree
//! drops one allocation per node — the shadow list, the archetype of the whole
//! migration — and still lands inside the noise. The sibling benchmark measured
//! the same scenario 10–16% *faster* on stand-in widgets; the difference is
//! entirely the payload, and that is the finding this benchmark exists for.
//!
//! **Widget size, not the signature, decides the conversion.** An erased widget
//! reserves 64 bytes inline. A `SizedBox` leaf is 40 bytes, stays in the handle,
//! and converts **half as expensively** consuming, because the value is read out
//! in one move instead of field by field through a reference. A real
//! `Container` is **512 bytes** — eight times the budget — so it always lives in
//! a pooled block, and the consuming conversion copies all 512 bytes out of that
//! block before the concrete `to_element` runs. That copy costs about 18 ns per
//! node and is the entire regression. The knobs are therefore the inline budget
//! of [`aimer::AnyWidget`] and the size of the widget structs themselves
//! (`Container` is mostly an inline `BoxDecoration`), neither of which is a
//! question about `self` versus `&self`.
//!
//! **The retained child is what the migration bought.** A dirty-marked frame
//! under a `Button` — a hover, a press, a scroll offset, a resize — costs a
//! third less time and 63 fewer allocations, because the child element is placed
//! again instead of being built again. That is the scenario a user feels, it is
//! the largest absolute number on the table, and it outweighs the per-node
//! conversion regression as long as a tree is rebuilt more often than it is
//! created. The allocation count also shows the limitation the migration left
//! open: 46 allocations per frame is not zero, because a re-placed retained
//! child is still marked needs-rebuild and its own build closures run again.
