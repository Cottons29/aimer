This plan redesigns Aimer's `StateUpdater<S>` so framework users can move the
same updater into multiple callbacks without calling `.clone()`, while keeping
state cleanup deterministic and preserving the native and portable backends.

The public `StateUpdater<S>` becomes a small, non-owning handle backed by
`StateUpdaterGeneration<T>`. The live state, mutation queue, dirty flag, and
failure state remain owned by `StateStorage`. Copying the handle copies only
its slot identity. It does not copy `S`, increment a reference count, or extend
the state lifetime.

`StateStorage` is an owner lease, not the lookup table itself. A single
UI-thread-local `StateSlotArena` owns type-erased slot metadata and values for
the lifetime of that UI thread. Each inserted slot receives an arena index and
a generation; the live `(index, generation)` pair is unique. The arena keeps
the generation metadata after a slot is invalidated, clears the value,
increments the generation, and reuses the index only after that check. A
generation counter that would overflow retires its slot permanently instead
of wrapping.

This topology gives a copied updater a safe lookup path without putting an
`Rc`, `Weak`, context pointer, or owner reference in the public handle. It also
means that `StatefulElement` can remain type-erased: the arena downcasts a
slot to `UpdaterSlot<S>` only after validating the key. The thread-local arena
is safe for the UI-thread-only API and avoids a raw pointer to an element field
whose address could change while an element is being boxed or moved.

## Decision

Use an Aimer-owned `StateStorage` and `StateUpdaterGeneration<T>` seam instead
of exposing `Rc` through the public updater. The implementation may borrow the
generational-storage technique used by Freya, but the Aimer interface should
use these names and own the lifecycle rules.

Implement the first version with `std` collections: a `Vec` of erased slot
values plus a free-index list and a thread-local arena. Do not add a third-party
arena dependency unless a benchmark demonstrates that the standard
implementation is inadequate. The storage seam must remain private to
`aimer_widget`.

The current implementation in
`crates/aimer_widget/src/widget/stateful.rs` cannot implement `Copy` because
`StateUpdaterInner<S>` contains four `Rc` values:

```rust
struct StateUpdaterInner<S> {
    tx: Rc<StateMutationQueue<S>>,
    state: Rc<SyncState<S>>,
    dirty_source: Rc<DirtySource>,
    failure: Rc<FailureState>,
}
```

`Rc::clone` increments a reference count. A bitwise copy of an `Rc` would not
increment that count and would be unsound. Keep these `Rc` values in a private
`StateStorage` slot and expose only a copyable `StateUpdaterGeneration` key.

## User-facing result

After this change, code in `State::build` can look like this:

```rust
fn build(&self, _ctx: &BuildContext) -> impl Widget {
    let updater = self.updater;

    // before copy: let on_press_updater = updater.clone();
    Column::new()
        .child(
            Button::new()
                .on_press(move || updater.set_state(|state| state.count += 1))
                .child(Text::new("+")),
        )
        .child(
            Button::new()
                .on_press(move || updater.set_state(|state| state.count -= 1))
                .child(Text::new("-")),
        )
}
```

`Button::on_press` is a zero-argument callback and a completed `Button` must
have a child; the example intentionally shows those repository conventions.
Each `move` closure receives a copy of the handle. Both callbacks address the
same live state, but neither callback owns that state. The `StateUpdater`
remains UI-thread-only and is still not a general `Send + Sync` handle.

## Target ownership model

```text
StatefulElement
    owns a non-copyable StateStorage lease
        claims one StateSlotArena entry
            owns state, mutation queue, dirty source, and failure state

StateUpdater<S>
    stores Option<StateUpdaterGeneration<UpdaterSlot<S>>>
    is Copy and Clone
    resolves through the UI-thread-local StateSlotArena
    does not own the slot or lease
```

The owner lease is the RAII lifetime guard. The arena stores no strong owner
reference, so a copied updater cannot keep the lease alive. During old/new
element overlap, an internal `StateStorage::clone_for_reconciliation` may
share the owner lease; the slot remains live until the last live element-side
lease drops. The keyed registry stores only a `Weak` owner reference. When the
last owner lease drops, the arena clears the slot value and advances its
generation. A later operation through a stale handle therefore cannot reach a
reused slot.

The stale-handle contract is fixed rather than deferred: `try_read` returns
`None` and `try_set_state` returns `None` for an empty, dropped, wrong-type,
or consumed slot, and neither invokes or queues its callback. Existing
panicking methods retain the uninitialized diagnostic and report a dropped or
consumed live slot with a framework diagnostic. `set_state` remains a no-op
after a recorded state failure, matching the current recovery behavior.

## Public handle shape

The native core should have a shape equivalent to:

```rust
use std::{marker::PhantomData, rc::Rc};

pub struct StateUpdater<S> {
    slot: Option<StateUpdaterGeneration<UpdaterSlot<S>>>,
    _ui_thread_only: PhantomData<Rc<()>>,
}

impl<S> Copy for StateUpdater<S> {}

impl<S> Clone for StateUpdater<S> {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        *self
    }
}

enum UpdaterSlot<S> {
    Native {
        tx: Rc<StateMutationQueue<S>>,
        state: Rc<SyncState<S>>,
        dirty_source: Rc<DirtySource>,
        failure: Rc<FailureState>,
    },
    #[cfg(feature = "portable-guest")]
    Portable(crate::portable::state::PortableStateHandle<S>),
}
```

The `Copy` and `Clone` implementations for both `StateUpdater` and
`StateUpdaterGeneration` must remain manual. A derive may add an unnecessary
`S: Copy` or `T: Copy` bound. The `S` type itself must not need to implement
`Copy`. `StateUpdaterGeneration<T>` contains a `StateSlotKey` and
`PhantomData<fn() -> T>`; it never stores a `T` value.

The concrete private key types are:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct StateSlotKey {
    index: u32,
    generation: u64,
}

struct StateUpdaterGeneration<T: ?Sized> {
    key: StateSlotKey,
    _marker: PhantomData<fn() -> T>,
}

impl<T: ?Sized> Copy for StateUpdaterGeneration<T> {}

impl<T: ?Sized> Clone for StateUpdaterGeneration<T> {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        *self
    }
}
```

`StateUpdaterGeneration::try_resolve` looks up `key` in the thread-local
arena, validates the generation, downcasts the erased slot to `T`, and runs a
closure while the arena borrow is held. It never returns a reference whose
lifetime outlives that closure unless a guard explicitly retains the validated
borrow.

The framework creates the slot under `StateStorage`:

```rust
let (storage, slot) = StateStorage::insert(UpdaterSlot::Native {
    tx: tx.clone(),
    state: state_cell.clone(),
    dirty_source: dirty_source.clone(),
    failure: failure.clone(),
});

let updater = StateUpdater {
    slot: Some(slot),
    _ui_thread_only: PhantomData,
};
```

The `StateStorage` instance must be retained by the live `StatefulElement`.
Returning a `StateUpdaterGeneration` after dropping its storage creates a
stale, but still safely checkable, handle. `StateStorage` owns an internal
lease token whose `Drop` invalidates the arena entry. The arena metadata remains
stable while copied generations can still be checked; dropping a state recycles
the value slot without freeing the generation metadata. The key is arena-wide,
not local to one `StateStorage`, so two live elements cannot alias through the
same `(index, generation)` pair.

## Method behavior

Every operation resolves the slot before touching the current backend values.
The native and portable variants share generation lookup and then apply their
existing backend-specific queue, dirty, failure, and redraw behavior:

```rust
impl<S: 'static> StateUpdater<S> {
    pub fn set_state(&self, mutation: impl FnOnce(&mut S) + 'static) {
        let slot = self.slot.expect("StateUpdater is not initialized");
        slot.try_resolve(|slot| match slot {
            UpdaterSlot::Native { tx, dirty_source, failure, .. } => {
                if failure.is_failed() {
                    return;
                }
                tx.push(Box::new(mutation));
                if dirty_source.mark() {
                    request_animation_frame();
                }
            }
            #[cfg(feature = "portable-guest")]
            UpdaterSlot::Portable(handle) => handle.queue(mutation),
        })
        .unwrap_or_else(|error| panic_state_updater_resolution(error));
    }

    pub fn read<R>(&self, read: impl FnOnce(&S) -> R) -> R {
        let slot = self.slot.expect("StateUpdater is not initialized");
        slot.try_resolve(|slot| match slot {
            UpdaterSlot::Native { state, .. } => {
                let state = unsafe {
                    (&*state.0.get())
                        .as_ref()
                        .expect("State has already been consumed during reconciliation")
                };
                read(state)
            }
            #[cfg(feature = "portable-guest")]
            UpdaterSlot::Portable(handle) => handle.read(read),
        })
        .unwrap_or_else(|error| panic_state_updater_resolution(error))
    }
}
```

The production implementation should use Aimer's existing diagnostic and
recovery paths instead of the abbreviated panic messages above. Preserve the
existing `track_caller`, `frame_work_stats`, failure short-circuit,
`request_animation_frame`, and portable dirty/rebuild behavior while moving the
backend access behind the generation resolver.

Keep `set_state_with<V: Clone + Send + 'static>` and its
`FnOnce(&mut S, V) + Send + 'static` bounds source-compatible. It must clone
the supplied value exactly once before queueing the mutation, as it does now;
the generation lookup must not add another value or updater clone.

Add a non-panicking operation for callbacks that may legitimately outlive a
widget:

```rust
pub fn try_read<R>(&self, read: impl FnOnce(&S) -> R) -> Option<R>;
pub fn try_set_state(&self, mutation: impl FnOnce(&mut S) + 'static) -> Option<()>;
pub fn has_state(&self) -> bool;
pub unsafe fn set_state_unchecked(&self, mutation: impl FnOnce(&mut S) + 'static);
pub unsafe fn read_state_unchecked(&self) -> StateReadGuard<'_, S>;
```

`try_read` and `try_set_state` perform the same generation, type, failure, and
consumed-state checks as the panicking methods. A rejected operation must not
run a supplied closure, enqueue a mutation, request a frame, or emit a
repeated diagnostic for an expected stale callback.

`has_state` is a quiet liveness check and returns `false` for an empty, stale,
consumed, failed, or wrong-type slot. `set_state_unchecked` is an explicit
unsafe fast path: callers must prove that the updater is initialized, its
owner is still live, the state has not been consumed or failed, and the call is
on the UI thread. It does not provide a fallback for stale callbacks.
`read_state_unchecked` has the same lifetime and thread requirements, returns a
`StateReadGuard` that retains the slot read lease, and additionally requires
that no conflicting portable `RefCell` borrow is active.

Change both native and portable `read_state` methods to return the same
`StateReadGuard<'_, S>` representation. The guard must retain the validated
slot borrow/token until it is dropped; it must never be a bare `&S` obtained
from a temporary owner or lookup borrow. Keep `read` as the preferred API and
add `try_read_state() -> Option<StateReadGuard<'_, S>>` if direct field syntax
is still needed by callbacks. The guard's `Deref` preserves ordinary
`updater.read_state().field` use, but changing the native return type is a
public API change: update affected call sites and document the migration.

## Stateful element integration

Add a non-copy storage owner field to `StatefulElement`:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

struct StatefulElement {
    state_storage: RefCell<StateStorage>,
    // existing fields
}
```

`StateStorage` itself owns an internal `Rc<SlotOwner>` only for framework-side
handoff. It is not exposed through `StateUpdater`, and it is not stored
strongly in the keyed registry. `StatefulElement` is non-generic, so the
storage value is type-erased in the arena while its slot is downcast to the
requested `UpdaterSlot<S>` at use time.

During initial construction:

1. Create the `StateStorage`.
2. Insert the updater slot into that storage.
3. Pass the copyable updater to `init_state`.
4. Retain the storage in the element.

The type-erased `state_sender` can store an `Rc<dyn Any>` containing the
copyable `StateUpdater<S>`, or an equivalent type-erased slot handle. The
`state_updater<S>()` helper should downcast the handle and return `Some(*handle)`
instead of rebuilding an updater from four cloned `Rc` values.

The existing `state_any` state cell can remain separate during the first
native migration so configuration adoption stays localized. The updater slot
can continue to point at the existing `Rc<SyncState<S>>` and mutation queue.
This keeps the first change small while moving ownership of the public updater
behind the new handle seam.

Preserve the current failure and reconciliation fields, including
`state_revision`, `failed`, and `failure`; the updater generation is a lifetime
identity and must not be substituted for the mutation revision used to choose
among duplicate keyed copies.

## Reconciliation and keyed state

Reconciliation must preserve the `StateStorage` lease that owns the live state:

1. An unkeyed fresh element creates a fresh candidate owner and candidate
   state.
2. `adopt_state_from` identifies the old element as the live state source and
   obtains an internal owner-lease clone before changing any type-erased field.
3. The new element adopts the old state cell, updater handle, rebuild closure,
   and owner lease. Replacing its candidate lease drops the candidate slot.
4. The old element may retain its lease during the old/new overlap, but the
   keyed registry retains only a `Weak` lease and cannot extend the lifetime.
5. The copied updater stored in the live `S` continues to resolve the old live
   slot.

The handoff must be rollback-safe. If configuration adoption, rebuilding, or
child reconciliation fails, the old live owner and its failure diagnostics must
remain valid; do not invalidate the old slot before the replacement has
successfully claimed it.

The keyed construction fast path is different: it creates a temporary state
cell only for `adopt_config_from`, reuses the live owner lease from
`LiveKeyedState`, and does not initialize or register a second live updater
slot. The temporary candidate cell and any candidate lease are dropped after
configuration adoption. The unkeyed `adopt_state_from` path and the keyed
`try_new_with_identity` path must both be covered independently.

Add a `Weak<SlotOwner>` to `KeyedStateEntry` and a temporary strong owner lease
to `LiveKeyedState`. `register_keyed_state` must publish the lease without
creating a strong registry root; otherwise a removed keyed element would stay
alive solely because the lookup table still contains it. A copied handle
without the live owner is allowed to become stale.

Treat `StateUpdater<S>` as a runtime field in `State::adopt_config_from`.
Document that implementations must not assign `new`'s updater, owner, queue,
or other runtime handles into the live state. The generic framework cannot
rebind an arbitrary user field after `adopt_config_from` returns. Built-in
states and examples must follow this rule, and the candidate-updater test must
prove that a published candidate handle becomes stale after adoption.

Add assertions that after adoption:

- the live updater and the rebuilt element resolve the same slot;
- a candidate updater does not continue targeting the discarded candidate;
- the old storage remains alive until the new live element has adopted it;
- dropping the owning storage invalidates all copied handles.

## Portable backend

The `portable-guest` branch must follow the same public model. It cannot keep
`PortableStateHandle<S>` directly inside `StateUpdater`, because that handle
currently contains `Rc` values.

Use the same thread-local `StateSlotArena` as native code. The portable
`UpdaterSlot<S>` variant stores the existing `PortableStateHandle<S>` in the
arena, while the public updater contains only the common generation key.
`PortableLiveStateRegistry` retains a `StateStorage` lease alongside each
`PortableStateHandle`, and its drain function continues to apply queued
mutations and refresh the serialized `StateRegistry` entry at the existing
rebuild boundary. This keeps `StateUpdater::set_state` independent of a
`PortableBuildContext` argument while preserving portable FIFO and coalescing
behavior.

`finish_generation` must retain only entries claimed by the completed
generation. Before clearing the claim set, remove unclaimed live entries and
drop their leases and `PortableStateHandle`s. Keep the encoded `StateRegistry`
snapshot separately so a stable slot that reappears can restore its retained
fields into a new live state; its new arena generation must not match any old
copied updater. `abort_build` must preserve entries from the last completed
generation and roll back only live entries created by the failed transaction.

When a `PortableBuildContext` is dropped, all remaining live-state leases must
drop and invalidate their arena slots. A callback registry or async future from
an older context may still hold a copied updater, but its `try_` operation must
return the stale result after context teardown or slot removal. If the same
stable slot is claimed again, it receives a new arena generation. Add tests for
context drop, unclaimed-slot pruning, slot reappearance, and delayed async
callbacks.

Use the common `StateReadGuard` representation for native and portable reads.
Portable `RefCell` borrows and native validated borrow tokens must both prevent
the underlying slot from being invalidated while a guard is alive.

## Dependency and module seam

Create `StateStorage` and `StateUpdaterGeneration<T>` as private implementation
modules in `aimer_widget` unless another Aimer crate needs the same storage
seam. Ordinary widget users should only see `StateUpdater<S>` and its
documented methods.

The private storage seam consists of:

```rust
struct StateSlotArena {
    slots: Vec<ArenaSlot>,
    free_indices: Vec<u32>,
}

struct ArenaSlot {
    generation: u64,
    value: Option<Box<dyn Any>>,
}

struct StateStorage {
    owner: Rc<SlotOwner>,
}
```

`StateStorage::insert` registers a type-erased value in the thread-local arena
and returns `(StateStorage, StateUpdaterGeneration<T>)`. `SlotOwner` stores the
`StateSlotKey` and invalidates it when its last internal lease drops. The keyed
registry may hold only a `Weak<SlotOwner>`. `StateUpdaterGeneration<T>` validates
the key and downcasts the erased value before running a closure. No raw pointer
may bypass both the generation check and the owner lifetime protocol.

The arena and its metadata remain alive for the UI thread, while slot values
and owner leases are reclaimed normally. The implementation must document the
single-threaded invariant around native `UnsafeCell` access and ensure a read
guard prevents owner invalidation until the guard is dropped.

## Migration phases

### Phase 0: contract and storage design

- Implement the thread-local `StateSlotArena`, `StateSlotKey`, and
  `StateStorage` lease with type-erased slot validation.
- Implement manual `Copy` and `Clone` for `StateUpdaterGeneration<T>` without a
  `T: Copy` bound.
- Fix the stale, empty, failed, and consumed operation contract before changing
  the public updater implementation.
- Add direct storage tests for independent slots, owner drop, generation
  reuse, wrong-type lookup, and generation overflow retirement.

### Phase 1: compile-time contract

- Implement manual `Copy` and `Clone` for the public updater.
- Add compile assertions proving `StateUpdater<NonCopyState>: Copy`.
- Preserve `set_state`, `set_state_with`, `read`, `empty`, and the existing
  frame-stat and diagnostic behavior.
- Preserve the UI-thread-only auto-trait behavior.
- Change native and portable `read_state` to the common guard representation,
  update call sites, and document the public API migration.
- Add the unsafe `read_state_unchecked` fast path without weakening the guard's
  slot-lifetime invariant.

### Phase 2: native construction and reconciliation

- Create and retain the owner in `StatefulElement`.
- Build updaters from one copyable slot.
- Carry the live owner through keyed and unkeyed state adoption.
- Replace the four-`Rc` downcast path in `state_updater`.
- Keep the keyed registry weak and make owner handoff rollback-safe.
- Remove redundant updater clones from framework construction code where the
  only purpose was ownership transfer.

### Phase 3: stale-handle contract

- Add `try_read`, `try_set_state`, and `try_read_state` with the fixed result
  behavior described above.
- Keep existing panicking methods for programmer errors and make their
  uninitialized, dropped, and consumed diagnostics distinct.
- Add lifecycle tests for callbacks retained after unmount.

### Phase 4: portable backend

- Store the portable backend behind the same copyable generational handle.
- Preserve stable slot restoration and state revision behavior.
- Prune unclaimed live entries at a completed generation while retaining the
  serialized snapshot policy described above.
- Test first-generation creation, retained generations, duplicate slots, slot
  removal, context drop, and delayed callbacks.

### Phase 5: user migration and cleanup

- Completed: examples and built-in widgets use direct updater copies at the
  audited callback and ownership-transfer sites.
- `.clone()` remains source-compatible because `Clone` is still implemented,
  while unnecessary framework-internal updater clones were removed. The
  remaining updater-named clones are intentional `Rc`/owner or fixture-storage
  clones.
- Document that `Copy` does not extend widget lifetime and that stale handles
  must not be used for new work after unmount.
- A current native allocation/frame baseline is recorded below. A historical
  before/after run remains pending until a clean pre-migration checkout is
  available.

## Verification plan

### Compile-time tests

```rust
fn assert_copy<T: Copy>() {}

fn compile_copy_contract() {
    assert_copy::<StateUpdater<NonCopyState>>();
    assert_copy::<StateUpdaterGeneration<UpdaterSlot<NonCopyState>>>();
}
```

Also retain compile-fail checks proving that `StateUpdater<S>` is not `Send`
or `Sync` in both default and `portable-guest` builds. Add compile coverage
for the common `StateReadGuard` return type and the unchanged `set_state_with`
signature.

### Runtime tests

- Two callbacks copied from one updater mutate the same state.
- Copying an updater does not clone or move the state value.
- A non-`Copy` state type works without additional bounds.
- Multiple queued updates preserve FIFO order and existing coalescing rules.
- An empty updater still reports the existing initialization diagnostic.
- A stale updater after unmount cannot access freed state.
- A stale generation cannot access a newly reused slot.
- Dropping the last `StateStorage` lease drops a non-`Copy` state value, while
  a copied updater does not keep it alive.
- Reconciliation keeps the old live updater target.
- Candidate state and candidate updater are discarded together, including the
  keyed construction fast path.
- Keyed reorder preserves the correct updater target.
- Portable state handles preserve the same behavior after context teardown,
  unclaimed-slot pruning, slot reappearance, and delayed async callbacks.
- A read guard keeps its slot valid until the guard is dropped.
- Built-in `adopt_config_from` implementations preserve the live updater rather
  than copying the candidate's runtime handle.
- Failed portable build transactions retain the previous live entries and roll
  back only entries created by the failed attempt.
- Child-reconciliation failures are recovered without leaking a panic, retain
  the previous live owner where applicable, and install a stable diagnostic
  element for the failed candidate/rebuild.
- Owner and read-lease drops after thread-local arena shutdown are ignored
  safely; the shutdown ordering regression is covered by a spawned-thread
  test.

### Performance checks

The expected source-level improvement is zero explicit `StateUpdater` clones at
the audited framework/example call sites. Since the new `Clone` implementation
is itself `*self`, removing the spelling does not prove a runtime improvement;
the measurements below are a current baseline and do not claim a frame-time
gain.

The reproducible native probe is
`cargo run -p aimer_laboratory --example state_updater_profile --release`.
It uses seven rounds, a one-million-copy loop, a 32-callback stateful tree, a
256-update batch, and a thread-local redraw requester. On 2026-09-02 the
final release run reported:

| operation | p50 | p95 | allocations/op | frame requests |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `StateUpdater` copy, 1M moves | 5.16 ns | 5.72 ns | 0.00 | — |
| stateful construction, 32 callbacks | 31.19 µs | 41.10 µs | 752.81 | — |
| queue + rebuild, empty callback tree | 0.03 µs/update | 0.03 µs/update | 0.03 | 1.00/batch |
| queue + rebuild, 32-callback tree | 0.67 µs/update | 0.72 µs/update | 4.65 | 1.00/batch |

The allocator column counts allocation/reallocation calls on the benchmark
thread, not allocated bytes. Construction includes the retained stateful
element and its 32-button child tree; queue-plus-rebuild includes the normal
reconciliation work.

The end-to-end native probes were also run in release mode:

- `framework_phase_profile`: for 32/256/2048 nodes, dirty reconciliation p50
  was 30.90/140.37/901.76 µs; cached draw p50 was 12.83/10.24/5.53 µs.
- `framework_baseline`: the 256-row stateful cached-frame case was 10.46 µs
  p50 with 1.00 allocation operation per frame; the 256-row eager cold frame
  was 36.88 µs p50 with 44.14 allocation operations.
- The native profile executable was 16,960,032 bytes under the workspace
  release profile. No portable guest executable is produced by this
  laboratory target, so portable binary size is not compared here.

Portable behavior was compile- and test-checked with
`cargo check -p aimer --features portable-guest` and
`cargo test -p aimer_widget --features portable-guest --lib` (329 passed).
Repeat the same profile against a clean pre-migration revision before making
an optimization or regression claim.

## Resolved decisions and remaining risks

- The public updater is a key into one UI-thread-local arena. The key is
  arena-wide, and consists of an index plus generation; it is not an index into
  an individual element's storage.
- `StateStorage` is the only element-side lifetime lease. The keyed registry is
  weak, and copied updaters never own a lease. The arena keeps only enough
  metadata to reject stale generations.
- `try_read`, `try_set_state`, and `try_read_state` reject empty, dropped,
  wrong-type, failed, and consumed slots without running user closures. The
  panicking methods retain framework diagnostics for programmer errors.
- Native and portable `read_state` use the common guard representation; the
  native bare-reference API is intentionally not retained.
- `read_state_unchecked` skips validity checks only under an explicit unsafe
  contract and still returns a guard that retains the slot read lease.
- `State::adopt_config_from` must preserve runtime handles, including the
  updater. This is a documented trait invariant because the framework cannot
  rewrite arbitrary user fields after the callback returns.
- Portable live-state entries are pruned when no longer claimed, while the
  encoded `StateRegistry` snapshot remains available for explicit stable-slot
  restoration. Failed builds do not prune the last completed generation.
- Arena release paths use `try_with` and fail closed during TLS destruction;
  no state lookup is needed once the owning thread is shutting down.
- Do not implement `Copy` by storing an `Rc` or a pointer to an element field.
  Any unsafe native access must be confined to the UI thread and protected by
  the arena generation and guard lifetime rules.

The remaining risks are the cost of a thread-local type-erased lookup on
callback-heavy paths and the existing native `UnsafeCell` invariants. The
current allocation/frame cost is measured, but a historical comparison still
requires the pre-migration implementation.

## Acceptance criteria

The plan is complete when:

- `StateUpdater<NonCopyState>` implements `Copy` and `Clone` without an
  `S: Copy` bound;
- `StateUpdaterGeneration<T>` also implements `Copy` and `Clone` without a
  `T: Copy` bound;
- users can move one updater variable into multiple `move` callbacks without
  writing `.clone()`;
- all callbacks address the same live state slot;
- state is released when its last element-side owner lease is removed;
- stale copied handles fail safely according to the fixed `try_` and panicking
  method contracts;
- `read_state` never exposes a reference that outlives its validated guard;
- keyed/unkeyed reconciliation preserves the live owner and state;
- portable live entries are pruned without losing the separately defined
  serialized snapshot behavior;
- `adopt_config_from` preserves runtime updater handles;
- `set_state_with` and existing diagnostics remain source-compatible;
- native and portable backends pass focused lifecycle and mutation tests;
- the existing UI-thread-only contract remains intact.
