//! Keyboard focus, made visible.
//!
//! Two boxes sit side by side. Exactly one of them may own the keyboard at a
//! time, and the one that does draws a border. Clicking a box gives it focus,
//! clicking the page behind them takes focus away, and `Tab` / `Shift-Tab`
//! move it from one box to the other.
//!
//! The whole of that behaviour comes from one handle — [`aimer::FocusNode`] —
//! and one promise: an element that returns a node from
//! [`EventElement::focus_node`] is a *focusable target*. Everything else is the
//! framework's:
//!
//! - a press is routed to whatever is under it, and focus moves to the nearest
//!   focusable target it hit, or to nothing at all when it hit nothing
//!   focusable;
//! - `Tab` walks the focusable targets of the frame in tree order;
//! - the element that gains or loses focus is told so with
//!   [`ElementEvent::FocusGained`] and [`ElementEvent::FocusLost`].
//!
//! Any subtree becomes such a target by wrapping it in [`aimer::Focusable`],
//! which is all this example uses to turn two plain containers into things the
//! keyboard can be given to.
//!
//! The node itself lives in the *state*, never in the widget: widgets are
//! rebuilt on every `set_state` and thrown away, while focus ownership must
//! survive those rebuilds. Cloning a node yields another handle to the same
//! target, not a second target, which is exactly what a rebuild needs.
